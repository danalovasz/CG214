    <p> My roommate Biz, and I cried a lot to this song last year... We were really confused about life. We are not less confused now, but we've made ourselves believe that we are.</p>
    
    <P>Freshmen Year was a huge milestone in my life, as I am sure it was in everyone's life (especially those going to school in New York City). We are thrown from our hometowns into this huge city, where each month is equivalent to a year in a normal persons life.</P>

    <p>I had some of the most memorable days of my life during this year, and I really started to realize that time is irreversible. I realized, if I do not make the most of my life now, I will regret it... So that is what I did.</p>

    <p>There was this one day inparticular that sticks out the most from this year, and that is when me, my roommate biz, and our friend Dylan decided to go to the Rockaways, even though the becahes were closed. It was one of those weird nice days in New York, where the winter was transitioning to spring, so we decided no one could stop us from living our lives today. Once again, my life turns into an NYU student's short film. We got on the A train to the rockaways,put out a blanket, turned on some music, wathced the ocean, and enjoyed eachothers company.</p>
