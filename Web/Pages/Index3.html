    <p> Now, Obviously this year is not over yet... but a lot has happened.I am still lost, but I have an apartment. (With April, and Biz)</p>
    
    <p>A lot of my friends have done amazing things so far this year, and I could not be happier for them. This is the year where I have become even more appriciative of my friends, and I did not think that was possible. The people we have in our lives at this age raise us in the ways that our parents cannot.</p>
